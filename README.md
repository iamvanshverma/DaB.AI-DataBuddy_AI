## üåü Key Features

**DataBuddy AI** goes beyond a basic chatbot, offering a comprehensive, multi-layered suite of analytical tools:

### üß† AI-Powered Insights & Analysis

This is the core intelligence layer, powered by the **Gemini API**:

* **Natural Language Query Engine:** Ask complex data questions in plain English (e.g., "What are the main trends in my sales data?" or "Show me outliers in the revenue column").
* **Quick Analysis Presets:** Instantly generate a **Comprehensive Summary, Statistical Patterns, Best Visualizations,** and a **Data Quality Issues** report with a single click.
* **AI-Generated Statistical Insights:** Raw statistical tables are automatically interpreted and explained in clear, actionable language, making complex data easy to understand.
* **Suggested Follow-up Questions:** The AI provides continuous guidance by suggesting the next logical questions for deeper data exploration.

### üìä Interactive Exploration & Visualizations

Tools for visual and manual data investigation:

* **Automated Overview Dashboard:** Instantly view high-level EDA plots upon data load, including **Distribution Plots** (Histograms, Box Plots) and a **Correlation Matrix**.
* **Custom Chart Builder:** Users can manually select granular **Chart Types** (e.g., Correlation Heatmap, Time Series, Multi-Variable Analysis), X-axis, Y-axis, and an optional Color column to create bespoke visualizations using libraries like **Plotly** and **Matplotlib**.
* **Categorical Data Analysis:** Dedicated tools for viewing **Bar Charts** and **Pie Charts** based on categorical columns like 'City' or 'Country'.

### üîé Advanced Data & Statistical Tools

The quantitative layer for rigorous data assessment:

* **Comprehensive Statistics:** Get detailed descriptive statistics including **Skewness, Kurtosis, Variance, IQR,** and **Coefficient of Variation (CV)** for all numeric columns, powered by **NumPy** for robust calculations.
* **Data Quality Assessment:** Dedicated analysis of **Missing Values**, including counts, percentages, and a **Missing Values Pattern** visualization plot.
* **Interactive Data Explorer:** Use **range sliders** for numeric columns and selection tools for categorical data to dynamically filter the dataset.
* **Analyze Filtered Data:** A powerful feature to run the AI-powered analysis *only* on the isolated data subset to investigate specific patterns or outliers.

### üìÑ Reporting and Export Automation

The final layer for sharing and portability:

* **Comprehensive Report Generator:** Generate a **Full Data Report** that compiles all AI insights, statistics, and visualizations into a single, professional document (Implied PDF/HTML format).
* **Granular Data Export:** Download specific analysis components like **Summary Statistics, Correlation Data,** or the **Filtered Dataset** for external use.
